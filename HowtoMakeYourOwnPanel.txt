Note: If you have a SNP set that is very different than the 1240k SNP set or whole-genome shotgun set then follow steps below and make panels (takes ~24 hours or more if the panels are larger than the 1240K panels).
Instructions for making panel:
	Step 1)  Get 1000 Genomes files with SNP positions corresponding to your dataset's SNPs.
	Step 2)  Convert 1000 Genomes files to eigenstrat format with the following endings: ${panel}.snp, ${panel}.eigenstratgeno, where ${panel} is the name of the 1000 Genomes population.
	Step 3)  Convert 1000 Genomes files to packedped format (.bed, .bim, .fam) and use plink2 to find all SNP pairs with high LD (e.g. r^2 > 0.2): plink2 --bfile prefix --r2 --out prefix
		Note: If you want to increase power marginally at the expense of increased computational time, set the r2 value less than 0.2 by using --ld-window-r2
	Step 4)  Use the following script to get the panels (directory_files is the directory where the .ld, .snp, and .eigenstratgeno files are, ${panel} is the name of the 1000 Genomes Population, ${panel_type} is the type of panel (name it something then keep that name for all subsequent analyses and replace 1240K with that name):
	Rscript Get_Haplotype_and_SNPfreqs_new.R directory_files ${panel} ${panel_type}
	Step 5) awk '{print $2 "-" $4}' ${panel}_${panel_type}_eig_heldout_noX.snp > ${panel}_${panel_type}_eig_heldout_noX_ChromPos.snp
	Step 6) gzip all of the panels.
