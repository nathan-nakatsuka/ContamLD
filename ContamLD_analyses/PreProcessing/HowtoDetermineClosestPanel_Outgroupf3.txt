Steps to determine the panel most genetically similar to your individual.

Step 1)  Merge your data with 1000 Genomes populations (26 of them) and Mbuti.DG from SGDP (Mallick et al., Nature 2016), for example, using mergeit (https://github.com/argriffing/eigensoft/tree/master/CONVERTF). A 1240K version of this is available at: https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data-compiled-published-papers

Step 2)  Create files for f3 calculations where the files are in the format below for all 1000Genomes populations (IndName is the name of your individual).:
1000GenomesPop1	IndName	Mbuti.DG
1000GenomesPop2	IndName	Mbuti.DG

Step 3)  Run qp3Pop from ADMIXTOOLS (https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools) with these files using inbreed: YES

Step 4)  Remove the top lines and bottommost line from the resulting files so that only the rows with "result: " are left.  This can be done with the grep function.

Step 5)  Concatenate all of these files into one file.

Step 6)  Run FindMaxOutgroupf3.R with the following form, where directory_files is the directory where your files are, concatenated_file is the file from Step 5, and output_file_name is the name of the file that will be outputted:
Rscript FindMaxOutgroupf3.R directory_files concatenated_file output_file_name
